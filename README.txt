  I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
The game should be run from the Main.java class. 
The out.txt file stores win and loss values for each of the levels.
Each level is different, has different paddle-width, ball/paddle color,number of lives, and velocity(xComponent) ,making it more difficult as the level difficulty increases. 
out.txt acts as a database for stored values.
